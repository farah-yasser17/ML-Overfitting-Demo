# ðŸ“Š Machine Learning Prediction & Overfitting Visualization

This project trains machine learning models on **array-based datasets** to make predictions and visualize performance.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- Train models on structured numerical array data.
- Visualize predictions and compare actual vs. predicted results.
- Detect and illustrate **overfitting** using:
  - Training vs. testing accuracy plots
  - Learning curves
  - Model complexity comparisons

## ðŸ“ˆ Overfitting Demonstration
The project shows how:
- Simple models may underfit (low accuracy for both training and testing data).
- Overly complex models may overfit (high training accuracy but low testing accuracy).
- Balanced models provide good generalization.
